# AWS Computer Vision Scientist & MLE Role Take Home


Data Science and Machine Learning Engineer Case Study Options
Please select and complete one of the following case studies. We are looking for you to demonstrate your machine learning engineering and data science skills using the language of your choice. You are not required to use AWS in your solution. If interviewing for a MLE position, please focus more on the data pipeline and engineering tasks necessary to deploy a model for inference. Likewise, if in a data science interview, please focus more on the data exploration and model training aspects of the task at hand. Your phone screen will be to review your code, so please refrain from slideshow-oriented presentations. Please send the completed work sample at least 2 days prior to the phone interview. On the day of the interview you will need access to a laptop/desktop as you will be sharing your screen and going through the work sample with the interviewer.


## Option 3: Geological Image Similarity *
BACKGROUND: A geology research company wants to create a tool for identifying interesting patterns in their imagery data. This tool will possess a search capability whereby an analyst provides an image of interest and is presented with other images which are similar to it. 
GOAL: Your task is to create the machine learning component for this image similarity application. The machine learning model should return the top K images that are most similar to this image based on a single image input. Please send a document displaying your code and thought process to your recruiter at least 24 hours prior to your interview.
